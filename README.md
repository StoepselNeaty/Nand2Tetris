1. assembler_dev.awk: As the name suggests, I'm writing an assembler in awk for the Nand2Tetris online course. You can find a specification of the assembler here (http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/chapter%2006.pdf). This project is incomplete. I am in the stage of filtering out all possible errors for A instructions.
